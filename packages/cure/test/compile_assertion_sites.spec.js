/**[API]:testing
 * 
 * A Compile Statements function should build test rigs from a 
 * source file. Each test rig SHOULD represent all necessary 
 * statements required to correctly assess the expression 
 * within the assertion site. Spurious statements MAY be 
 * included, but statements that have an effect on the result 
 * of the assertion expression MUST be included. 
 * 
 * There should be a unique test rig for each assertion site,
 * EXCEPT in the event the assertion site is part of a sequence
 * of assertion calls that MUST be run in order. This determination
 * is left to the user.
 * 
 * Any import requirement of an assertion site expression or it's
 * proceeding statements must be present within the test rig 
 * ImportSources.
