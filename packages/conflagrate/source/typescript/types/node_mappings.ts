        A template pattern may contain template insertion points marked by a [$]
        character. For each insertion point there is an action to perform depending
        on the surrounding syntax:
        
        1. Value-Index-Insertion

        \@\\n+\?? => This indicates the rendering of the node contained in parent.nodes[<\n*>] should be
                rendered and the result inserted at this point. 

        1. Value-Name-Insertion

        \@_\w+\?? => This indicates the rendering of the node referenced at parent[<\w+>] should be
                rendered and the result inserted at this point.

        2. Spread-Value-Insertion
        
        \@...[.\s] => This indicates that all node.nodes should be rendered and results inserted into
                the output string with a single character separating the entries. If there are proceeding 
                Value-Index-Insertion, the spread will start at the index location following the 
                one specified in Value-Index-Insertion. The spread will be delimited by the character 
                following [@...]

        3. Non-Value-Insertion 
        
        \@\w* => This indicates that a property of node should be inserted into the output
                string, after being coerced to a string value using the string constructor
                String()

        3. Conditional-Insertion
        
        \@(\w+,\.+) => This indicates the truthiness of a node property determines whether
                a string expression is   rendered.
